### The purpose of this project is to allow the user to create a readme.md file by answering prompts in the terminal.

### The user runs the index.js file in node and is presented with a series of prompts.
### The prompts are as follows: 

 - Project Title
 - Project Description
 - Installation instructions
 - Usage Info
 - Contributing guidelines
 - Testing instructions
 - The type of license (with choices of ISC, MIT, GNU)
 - User's GitHub username
 - User's email address

 ### The application creates a README.md file that takes the user's information that he/she has entered and formats it for them.
